# Crash and Error Logs

This directory contains detailed crash and error logs generated by the application. The **`crashes/`** folder is included in the repo so it exists on the host before the container runs. With Docker volume **`./logs:/app/logs`** and **`CRASH_LOG_DIR=/app/logs/crashes`**, the API writes **`ingest_progress.log`** as soon as it starts (and **`crash_*.log`** on exceptions). If no files appear, check that the API container is running and the volume is mounted.

## Directory Structure

## Crash Log Files

### Crash Reports (`crash_*.log`)

Each crash report contains:

1. **System Information**
   - Timestamp
   - Python version
   - Platform information
   - Process ID
   - Memory usage (RSS, VMS, percentage)
   - CPU usage
   - Thread count
   - System-wide memory statistics

2. **Exception Details**
   - Exception type and message
   - Full stack trace
   - Exception arguments

3. **Garbage Collection Info**
   - GC counts and statistics
   - GC thresholds

4. **Operation Context**
   - What operation was being performed
   - Document/file information (if applicable)
   - Request details (if applicable)
   - Progress information (pages processed, chunks processed, etc.)

5. **Additional Information**
   - Environment variables (sensitive data excluded)
   - Custom context data

### Memory Pressure Log (`memory_pressure.log`)

Continuous log of memory pressure events showing:
- Timestamp
- Current memory usage
- Memory thresholds
- System and process memory percentages
- Operation context

## When Crash Logs Are Created

Crash logs are automatically created when:

1. **Memory Errors** - Out of memory (OOM) errors
2. **System Errors** - System-level failures
3. **Unhandled Exceptions** - Critical unhandled exceptions
4. **Signal Termination** - Application terminated by signals (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
5. **Document Processing Failures** - Critical failures during document ingestion

## How to Use Crash Logs

1. **Identify the Issue**
   - Check the exception type and message
   - Review the stack trace to find where the error occurred

2. **Check Memory Usage**
   - Look at memory statistics at the time of crash
   - Compare with memory thresholds
   - Check if system memory was exhausted

3. **Review Context**
   - See what operation was being performed
   - Check document/file information
   - Review progress information to see how much was processed

4. **Analyze Patterns**
   - Look for recurring issues
   - Check memory_pressure.log for memory trends
   - Identify common failure points

## Example: Analyzing a Memory Crash

```
1. Open the crash log file
2. Check "SYSTEM INFORMATION" section:
   - memory_rss_mb: 3500 (exceeded 2GB threshold)
   - system_memory_percent: 95% (system memory exhausted)
3. Check "OPERATION CONTEXT" section:
   - pages_processed: 15
   - chunks_processed: 234
   - This shows the crash happened during PDF processing
4. Check "EXCEPTION DETAILS":
   - MemoryError: Memory threshold exceeded
   - Stack trace shows it happened in _iter_pages_ultra_safe
```

## Log Retention

- Crash logs are kept indefinitely (manual cleanup recommended)
- Memory pressure logs are appended continuously
- Consider archiving old logs periodically

## Security Note

Crash logs may contain:
- File paths
- Document names
- System information
- Environment variables (sensitive ones are excluded)

Do not share crash logs publicly without reviewing them first.
